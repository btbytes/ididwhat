# I Did What?

LightWeight activity tracker for macOS.

Started out as a translation of Pradyumna's [WhatDID](https://github.com/pradyuprasad/WhatDID) from Python to Nim.

Some features this project wants to add are:

1. [x] Convert from Python to Nim
1. [ ] Make it available as a [homebrew](//brew.sh) installable binary
1. [ ] Make it use MacOS configuration locations for storing the SQLite file
1. [ ] Make it start on boot using MacOS's native mechanism
1. [ ] Add a visualization interface. I'm thinking maybe an web app, or if I'm being aspirational use something like [Tauri](//tauri.app) to wrap it into a proper MacOS app.
